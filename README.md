# PAUSE
------
### Motivation
Our purpose in creating this software was to bring one of Microsoft Windows(TM) most fundamental system-services to unix systems. We hope our contribution will help developers all over the world to easily deploy their projects to other systems.
### Description
PAUSE redefines the service called throughout the "PAUSE" command on Microsoft Windows(TM) host systems. The basic tasks are:
* the OS locates the PAUSE daemon
* allocate the memory to execute the command
* execute the command and wait for a keystroke
* deallocate the memory
* exit the OS and resume the program
